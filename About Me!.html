            <p> Ever since I was little, technology was always in my hands. But it wasn't until I saw my dad and brother
                working on a computer, I was immediately invested. While I was good at Python, I didn't know anything
                about HTML or CSS. But it didn't deter me away from an amazing opportunity that is <a
                    href="#">Nextech.</a> <-- Psss... You should totally hover on me.</p>


                    <p> My passions for tech aside, I like to talk and meet new people, which the Catapult program has
                        certainly made that happen. I have a blue nose pitbull which you'll see glimpses of and if my
                        speech patterns/typing methods aren't clear, I am a sucker for literature and enjoy English
                        Class a little more than I should.</p>

                    <p> I plan to make something good out of my passions and energy, whether it's build websites or
                        provide help to others with the same interests, I just want to help. </p>
